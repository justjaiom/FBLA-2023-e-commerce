## Developement
### Code Used
HTML, CSS, and JS were used for the frontend of the website. The living room stores it's data in a SQL database (PHPmyAdmin) and connects via php code. The Self-developed SQL databases acts as a personal PMS (property management software).

## Support accross all platforms 
Our Website also has support for all forms of viewing. The Living Room is compatible with devices of all sizes and all OS's, and consistent improvements are being made for all.
